# The Lite Web Manifesto

## What Is the Lite Web?

The **Lite Web** is a simpler, faster, and more private alternative to today’s internet.

It replaces bloated, ad-filled web pages with clean, lightweight, self-contained content — more like reading a digital booklet than navigating a noisy app. It brings back what the web used to be: fast, quiet, and focused.

Why "lite"?

* **Lightweight** – Pages load instantly, even on slow networks.
* **Private** – No cookies, no trackers, no ads.
* **Durable** – Each page is a complete file you can save and keep forever.
* **Readable** – Calm layouts, no distractions.
* **Open** – Anyone can publish, host, and share content without gatekeepers.
* **User-controlled** – Readers can choose their own fonts, colors, and layouts; styles are intentionally simplified and not forced.
* **Media-capable** – Pages can include audio and video without DRM, giving users full control over how they watch, listen, and share.

The Lite Web is designed for readers, creators, and communities who value permanence, privacy, and simplicity over surveillance, profit, and exploitation.  And most importantly, it's a web where **the user is in control** — not just the creator. You're free to enjoy and interact with content on your terms — not how a platform or brand dictates.

## What Powers the Lite Web?

The Lite Web runs on the **Litepub protocol** — a new, open technology built from the ground up for small, encrypted, and self-contained content.

It defines how browsers and servers communicate to request and deliver pages — but unlike the traditional web, it avoids complexity. Instead of loading full HTML documents with external scripts, trackers, and ads, Litepub serves each page as a **compact digital booklet** based on the EPUB format (commonly used for eBooks).

But Litepub doesn't use the full EPUB standard. It focuses on a **simple, consistent subset** — just the parts needed for clean layout, styling, navigation, and offline readability. This makes Litepub pages:

* **Faster to load** – minimal overhead, zero bloat
* **Easier to build** – write in XHTML and link your assets
* **More predictable** – consistent behavior across devices and readers

Key features of Litepub:

* **Encrypted by default** – Every connection is secure, with no need for paid certificates
* **Private and tracker-free** – No cookies, ads, or surveillance
* **Self-contained** – Each page includes everything it needs, ready to download, archive, or share
* **Readable and durable** – Works like a book, built to last
* **Developer-friendly** – Just write XHTML and let the server package it into a Litepub-compatible EPUB
* **Automatic conversion** – Developers can also point the server at an existing HTML/CSS site, and it will simplify the content for readability and host it as a clean, reader-style Litepub page

In short: **Litepub is the engine**, and **the Lite Web is the experience it creates** — clean, fast, and forever yours. It focuses on structure, not scripts — making content easier to preserve, not harder.

## Why This Matters

The modern web has become heavy, extractive, and fragile. Pages are overloaded with surveillance tech, dependent on cloud services, and often break or disappear with time. Content is increasingly locked inside corporate silos where users have little control or ownership. What you read, create, or share is often tracked, monetized, or deleted — and almost never truly yours.

The Lite Web pushes in the opposite direction:

* It values **ownership over engagement**
* It enables **publishing without surveillance**
* It prioritizes **readability, resilience, and longevity**
* It helps **democratize the web again**, giving creators full control over their content
* It ensures that **users have the right to save, share, and preserve what they access**, by design

We believe information should be **accessible**, **archivable**, and **yours to keep**.

Because of the protocol and format, the kinds of exploitative practices seen on today’s web — like data harvesting, ad injection, and forced obsolescence — are not just discouraged on the Lite Web, they are nearly impossible by design. Future versions of the protocol will continue to build on this foundation, ensuring that user freedom and content ownership remain at the heart of everything we create.

## What We're Building

* A free and open protocol for publishing and reading self-contained content
* A simple server that dynamically packages `.xhtml` and html  into `.epub` pages
* A GUI-based browser that fetches, renders, and caches Litepub content with the option to download.
* A growing ecosystem of creators and readers who want a calmer, more durable web

This isn't a replacement for the web — it's a parallel space.
A quieter one. A simpler one.
One built to last, and one you can truly call your own.
