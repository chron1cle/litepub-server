# ðŸŒ± The Litepub Manifesto

## What Is the Lite Web?

The **Lite Web** is a simpler, faster, and more private alternative to todayâ€™s internet.

It replaces bloated, ad-filled web pages with clean, lightweight, self-contained content â€” more like reading a digital booklet than navigating a noisy app. It brings back what the web used to be: fast, quiet, and focused.

Why "lite"?

* **Lightweight** â€“ Pages load instantly, even on slow networks.
* **Private** â€“ No cookies, no trackers, no ads.
* **Durable** â€“ Each page is a complete file you can save and keep forever.
* **Readable** â€“ Calm layouts, no distractions.
* **Open** â€“ Anyone can publish, host, and share content without gatekeepers.

The Lite Web is designed for readers, creators, and communities who value permanence, privacy, and simplicity over surveillance, profit, and noise.

## What Powers the Lite Web?

The Lite Web runs on the **Litepub protocol** â€” a new, open technology built from the ground up for small, encrypted, and self-contained content.

Instead of sending complex HTML pages full of scripts, Litepub delivers content as compact, complete EPUB-based files. These are easy to read, easy to archive, and easy to share.

What makes Litepub different:

* **Self-contained** â€“ Everything (text, images, styling) comes in one package
* **Encrypted by default** â€“ No need for paid certificates or third parties
* **No tracking, no ads** â€“ It's privacy-respecting by design
* **Readable offline** â€“ Every page is downloadable and works anywhere
* **Simple to build** â€“ Creators write in clean XHTML and let the server do the rest

Litepub uses a simplified subset of the EPUB standard to make sure all content is consistent, lightweight, and future-proof. It focuses on structure, not scripts â€” making content easier to preserve, not harder.

## Why This Matters

The modern web has become heavy, extractive, and fragile. Pages are overloaded with surveillance tech, dependent on cloud services, and often break or disappear with time.

The Lite Web pushes in the opposite direction:

* It values **ownership over engagement**
* It enables **publishing without surveillance**
* It prioritizes **readability, resilience, and longevity**

We believe information should be **accessible**, **archivable**, and **yours to keep**.

## What We're Building

* A free and open protocol for publishing and reading self-contained content
* A simple server that dynamically packages `.xhtml` into `.epub` pages
* A GUI-based browser that fetches, renders, and caches Litepub content
* A growing ecosystem of creators and readers who want a calmer, more durable web

This isn't a replacement for the web â€” it's a parallel space.
A quieter one. A simpler one.
One you can take with you.
